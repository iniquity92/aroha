                    <p>Perhaps I was blind to the facts, stabbed in the back I couldn't trust my own homies just a bunch a dirty rats Will I, succeed, paranoid from the weed And hocus pocus try to focus but I can't see And in my mind I'ma blind man doin time Look to my future cause my past, is all behind me Is it a crime, to fight, for what is mine? Everybody's dyin tell me what's the use of tryin I've been Trapped since birth, cautious, cause I'm cursed And fantasies of my family, in a hearse And they say it's the white man I should fear But, it's my own kind doin all the killin here I can't lie, ain't no love for the other side Jealousy inside, make em wish I died Oh my Lord, tell me what I'm livin for Everybody's droppin got me knockin on heaven's door And all my memories, of seein brothers bleed And everybody grieves, but still nobody sees Recollect your thoughts don't get caught up in the mix Cause the media is full of dirty tricks Only God can judge me.</p>
